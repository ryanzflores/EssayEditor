## Essay Editor

This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, & Node) to allow students to upload their essays and have others suggest edits all in one place, without needing to share files.

## Usage

To create an essay, navigate to the Create Essay page present in the menu bar. Choose a short description for your essay, and paste in the contents of your essay into the content box. Press submit to save your essay. Your essay will appear in the essay list in the homepage of the app, along with the date it will be automatically deleted and links to make/view edits and manually delete the essay. Essays will automatically be deleted after three days. Please note that if you clear your cookies, your essay will disappear from the essay list, and cannot be recovered.

To allow another person to create edits for your essay, navigate to the homepage and find your essay in the essay list. Copy the link to make edits and send it to the person you would like to edit your essay. From that link, an editor can highlight a portion of your essay, write a note for the highlighted portion, and submit their edits for you to review. Once an edit is submitted, you will be able to view it by navigating to the homepage and clicking on the link to view edits. Select an edit from the dropdown list on the right to see what text it highlighted and what note was left.
